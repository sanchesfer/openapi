            The list of winners will contain at most `slots` entries per auction.
            It may contain fewer or no entries at all if there aren't enough products with usable bids, that is,
            a bid amount greater than the reserve price and belonging to a campaign with enough remaining budget.
            Bids become unusable if campaign budget is exhausted, the bid is disqualified to preserve spend pacing, etc.

          For promoted interactions, include the `resolvedBidId` field from the `/v2/auctions` response.

        In case you cannot send an impression when the product becomes visible, send us an impression event when the product was rendered in the HTML or, if that's also not possible, when your API returns the results.
        It is important to select the most specific event so that your vendors have more accurate CTR metrics, which will allow them to better predict their campaigns.
