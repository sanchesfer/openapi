    In order for a storefront to be able to run auctions in Topsort and report auction-related events back to Topsort,
    both the `/v2/auctions` and `/v2/events` endpoints must be integrated.

            The auction results.
            The list of winners will contain at most `slots` entries per auction.
            It may contain fewer or no entries at all if there aren't enough products with usable bids, that is,
            a bid amount greater than the reserve price and belonging to a campaign with enough remaining budget.
            Bids become unusable if campaign budget is exhausted, the bid is disqualified to preserve spend pacing, etc.

          Use the `/events` endpoint to notify Topsort about significant consumer interactions on the marketplace app:
          - **Impressions** — a set of impressions means such promotables have become visible to the consumer.
          - **Clicks** — a click is sent to Topsort when the consumer has clicked on a promotable.
          - **Purchases** — a purchase is sent to Topsort once a consumer places an order.

          For promoted interactions, include the `resolvedBidId` field from the `/v2/auctions` response.
          For unpromoted interactions, include the `entity` field to describe what was interacted with.
